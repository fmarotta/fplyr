I am submitting a new (minor) version of the package.

## Test environments
* Ubuntu 18.04 (R 3.6.3)
* Arch Linux (R 4.0.1)
* win-builder (oldrelease, release, and devel)
* R-hub (it failed on Windows Server devel because the package 'data.table' was not available)

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
No dependencies exist at this time.
