#' Read some chunks from a file into a \code{data.table}
#'
#' This function is useful to quickly glance at a big chunked file. It is similar
#' to the \code{head()} function, except that it does not read the first few lines, but
#' rather the first few blocks of the file. By default, only the first block will be read;
#' it is not advisable to read a large number of blocks in this way because they may
#' occupy a lot of memory. The blocks are saved to a \code{data.table}. See \code{?fplyr}
#' for the definitions of chunked file and block.
#'
#' @param input Path of the input file.
#' @param key.sep The character that delimits the first field from the rest.
#' @param sep The field delimiter (often equal to key.sep).
#' @param skip Number of lines to skip at the beginning of the file
#' @param header Whether the file has a header.
#' @param nblocks The number of blocks to read.
#' @param stringsAsFactors Whether to convert strings into factors.
#' @param select The columns (names or numbers) to be read.
#' @param drop The columns (names or numbers) not to be read.
#' @param col.names Names of the columns.
#' @param parallel Number of cores to use.
#'
#' @return A data.table containing the file truncated to the number of blocks specified.
